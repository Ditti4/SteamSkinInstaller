# Steam Skin Installer Catalog Helper

## Overview
This is a small helper tool to assist you extending the skin catalog.
This is a very basic tool and not convenient to use at all but it works and that's its main purpose.

## How does this work?
First, make sure you have a current version of the skin catalog file (skins.xml) in your current working directory (or rather: the directory you wan to start the tool from).
After that you should be able to start the tool and it should ask you for the new skin's details. Just fill them in and don't be afraid of making mistakes - if you notice that you mistyped something or pasted the wrong value you can still change that after the tool's done using a simple text editor.

If you're done, feel free to submit a pull request to the main repository including your new skin catalog so everyone can benefit from your work.

## Contributing
If you think you can make this tool more convenient to use than it is at the moment then please feel free to improve it
by forking it and creating a pull request containing your changes. If everything works I'll try to merge it within a day (no promise).
