# Steam Skin Installer

## Overview
Yay, an installer for Steam skins, supporting your laziness.

But seriously, this project aims to provide you with an easy way to explore and install new and update your existing Steam
skins (as long as you installed them with this installer).

## Usage
Well, that's pretty easy: start it, choose a skin you're interested in from the big list and hit "Install". The Steam Skin
Installer will then go ahead and get the skin archive for you, extract it, install required fonts (if any), do other required
stuff (which isn't implemented yet), move the skin to Steam's skin folder and apply it right away if you wish so. You don't
have to do anything anymore.

In the settings you can also choose to install an updater service (well, you'll be able to do so in the future (hopefully))
which will check for updates for your installed skins every now and then and either warn you or silently install the updates.
This (probably) command line tool can also be used to install skins the "headless" way so skin authors can just prepare
scripts which will install their skin without any user interaction.

## Planned features
Basically the whole second paragraph of the last section. This is what we've planned and what we'll try to realize in the
next days, weeks and months.

We also plan to get way more skins listed in the catalog file. This'll be a boring and brainless task for which we'd love to
get help from our community.

## Contributing
Feel we did something horribly wrong? Do you want to help us improve the Steam Skin Installer?
Do you want to extend the skin catalog? Do you want this project to disappear from Earth's surface?

If you answered all of those questions with a "yes", then you're crazy. If you answered all but the last one with "yes", then
we want and need your help. Whatever you might want to improve, just fork the repository, improve it and create a pull
request. We'll try to get back to you within a day so you either know that we'll merge your awesome changes right away
or get an idea on what you should try to improve; we don't want many and quick pull request, we want high-quality pull
request so please take your time to make sure your changes work for everyone.

Thank you in advance.
